      This PBMC reference dataset was generated as part of the [Hao and Hao et al, bioRvix 2020](https://satijalab.org/v4preprint) paper. It is comprised of data from eight volunteers enrolled in an HIV vaccine trial from which three time point samples were taken at day 0, 3, and 7 following vaccination. All 24 samples were processed with a CITE-seq panel of 228 TotalSeq A antibodies to generate single-cell RNA and ADT data. The data were then integrated using metholody described in the pre-print linked above to generate a weighted nearest neighbor (WNN) representation of the RNA and protein data jointly. This WNN representation is used in the Azimuth app to assign query celltypes, embed in the reference UMAP, and impute protein levels in the query dataset.
