    - question: The app didn’t work!
      incard: true
      answer: |
          To respect user privacy, we only collect basic usage statistics and do not store logs from user sessions of the app. We aim to clearly document the requirements for user-uploaded data, provide a detailed FAQ here, and display descriptive error messages in the app whenever possible.

          If the app returns an error message, you can also perform the same identical analysis using Seurat v4 following [mapping vignette](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/integration_mapping.html) and find support for any problems that arise during your use of the Seurat package [here](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat/issues).

          If you are receiving an error message or are unable generate output with the app, please read the FAQ below to ensure that your dataset meets our requirements. If this doesn't resolve your issue, and you'd like to help us improve the app, please file a Github issue describing the issue [here](https://github.com/satijalab/azimuth/issues).

    - question: Can I run the app myself?
      incard: true
      answer: |
          The source code is available [here](https://github.com/satijalab/azimuth). However, for users interested in performing these analyses outside the context of the Azimuth app, we suggest using Seurat v4 and using our vignette on [Mapping and annotating query datasets](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/integration_mapping.html) as an example. You can also download a Seurat v4 R script from the app once your analysis is complete to reproduce the results locally.

    - question: What is HuBMAP and how can I learn more?
      incard: true
      answer: |
          HuBMAP is a consortium of diverse research teams funded by the [Common Fund at the National Institutes of Health](https://commonfund.nih.gov/HuBMAP) that is working to create a framework for mapping the body at single cell resolution to better understand how the relationships among our cells affects out health. To learn more, visit the corsortium home page [here](https://hubmapconsortium.org/).

- category: Uploading Data
  title: Uploading Data
  questions:
    - question: What file types can I upload?
      incard: true
      answer: |
        We accept the following file types as input:

        * Seurat objects as RDS
        * 10x Genomics H5
        * H5AD
        * H5Seurat
        * Matrix/matrix/data.frame as RDS

        If uploading a Seurat object, it must contain an assay named 'RNA' with raw data in the 'counts' slot. Note that Azimuth uses only the (unnormalized) counts matrix.

    - question: Can you provide me with a sample input?
      incard: true
      answer: |
        All reference apps come with a 'demo' dataset which can be loaded with a button on the home sidebar. These represent datasets of the same tissue as the reference but were not included in the reference itself. These can be mapped to explore the app and mapping process without requiring the user to upload any data themselves.

    - question: How big can my uploaded dataset be?
      incard: true
      answer: |
          Uploads must be smaller than 1GB and contain less than 100,000 cells. If your dataset is larger than 100,000 cells, you can divide it into smaller chunks for mapping, or you can  map your dataset locally using Seurat v4.

          If you would like to upload an existing Seurat object, you can use `DietSeurat` to pare down the Seurat object before uploading it. This will preserve the RNA counts data and cell metadata, but discard everything else.

          ```R
          DefaultAssay(object) <- “RNA”
          object <- DietSeurat(object = object, assays = “RNA”)
          ```

    - question: What datasets can I map?
      incard: false
      answer: |
          To use your data in the app, we require that it has between 100 and 100,000 cells and has at least 250 genes in common with the reference. You should run the mapping algorithm locally in Seurat v4 or consider alternatives to reference mapping if your dataset does not meet these criteria.

    - question: Should I filter the genes in my dataset before uploading?
      incard: false
      answer: |
         We do not recommend pre-filtering genes in the data you upload. Users should upload an unprocessed counts matrix, for example, the output of the 10x Genomics CellRanger pipeline.

    - question: Should I map my batches separately or combined?
      incard: false
      answer: |
          We have observed that the UMAP and label transfer results are very similar whether a dataset containing multiple batches is mapped one batch at a time or combined. However, the mapping score returned by the app (see below for more discussion) may change. In the presence of batch effects, cells from certain batches sometimes receive high mapping scores when the batches are mapped separately but receive low mapping scores when batches are mapped together. Since the mapping score is meant to identify cells that are defined by a source of heterogeneity that is not present in the reference dataset, the presence of batch effects may cause low mapping scores.

    - question: What optimizations are in the app that are not default in Seurat?
      incard: false
      answer: |
          To optimize the web app time and resource consumption, we made several changes to the base Seurat mapping workflow.
          * SCTransform
            * When fitting generalized linear models, we use a representative set of 2000 genes and 2000 cells
            * To further speed up GLM model fitting, we use the recently developed  [glmGamPoi package](https://github.com/const-ae/glmGamPoi) from Constantin Ahlmann-Eltze and Wolfgang Huber.
          * Mapping
            * For many references, we leverage a downsampled reference. Downsampling is done to ensure good representation of all datasets and celltypes present in the full reference.
            * We leverage a previously computed and cached  neighbor index and neighbor list for the reference. This speeds up the neighbor-finding steps in the mapping algorithm.
            * For the approximate nearest neighbor finding steps in the algorithm, we use `n.trees = 20`, which provides speedup compared to default `n.trees = 50` with minimal impact on the quality of downstream results.
          * Analysis
            * We leverage the [presto package](https://github.com/immunogenomics/presto) from Ilya Korsunsky and Soumya Rayachauduri, for differential expression

- category: Preprocessing
  title: Preprocessing
  questions:
    - question: Can I preprocess my data myself?
      incard: true
      answer: |
          You can filter cells based on any criteria you want before uploading data to the app. However, the query data must be normalized uniformly with the reference by the app, so you must include the unnnormalized data in the ‘RNA’ assay ‘counts’ slot.

    - question: I can’t map cells after filtering in the “Preprocessing” tab
      incard: true
      answer: |
          There must be at least 100 cells remaining after filtering to proceed.

- category: Mapping
  title: Mapping
  questions:
    - question: How long will mapping take?
      incard: true
      answer: |
          Datasets of <10,000 cells will often finish processing in less than 1 minute. A 50,000 cell dataset may take around 3-4 minutes to preprocess, perform mapping, and prepare the visualizations; 100,000 cells may take around 8-9 minutes. Please be patient if we’re experiencing high load. It’s still running if you see the progress bar in the bottom right corner.

    - question: Can I run the mapping algorithm myself?
      incard: true
      answer: |
          Yes! Reference mapping is available in Seurat v4. See our vignette on [Mapping and annotating query datasets](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/integration_mapping.html) as an example. You can also download a customized Seurat v4 R script template after mapping on the “Download Results” tab to reproduce the analysis performed in the app.

    - question: Can I map to a different reference?
      incard: true
      answer: |
          Currently, we provide apps for the references summarized [here](/references/). However, you can build a reference and map query datasets to it using Seurat v4.

- category: Results
  title: Results
  questions:
    - question: What do the columns in the biomarkers table mean?
      incard: true
      answer: |
          The top 10 biomarkers for predicted cell type clusters with at least 15 query cells are calculated using differential expression analysis, using the [presto package](https://github.com/immunogenomics/presto). The columns of the table are:

            * avgExpr: mean value of feature for cells in cluster
            * auc: area under ROC
            * padj: Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p value
            * pct_in: percent of cells in the cluster with nonzero feature value
            * pct_out: percent of cells out of the cluster with nonzero feature value

    - question: Can I visualize my own metadata?
      incard: false
      answer: |
          If the file format you upload supports metadata and your file contains cell-level metadata, after mapping you can visualize categorical metadata fields (with up to 50 categories) on the "Cell Plots" tab, and numerical metadata fields on the "Feature Plots" tab.

    - question: Why aren’t all the predicted cell types available in the biomarkers table?
      incard: false
      answer: |
          Cell types must have at least 15 query cells of that predicted type to find biomarkers.

    - question: Where do the imputed protein values come from?
      incard: true
      answer: |
          If you are using a reference with ADT data (e.g. PBMC), expression values for the proteins are imputed for all query cells based on expression values measured using antibody-derived tags (ADTs) for reference cells using [CITE-seq](https://cite-seq.com/). Imputed expression values are computed based on the measured expression values in reference cells near to a mapped query cell. They are available to download as an Assay and to visualize in the Feature Plots tab.

    - question: Can I save my results?
      incard: false
      answer: |
          We do not support saving app sessions, so make sure to download the files you need before navigating away from the webpage in your browser. You can download the UMAP (Seurat Reduction RDS), cell type predictions and prediction scores (TSV), and imputed protein (Seurat Assay RDS) from the Downloads tab after mapping.

- category: Mapping QC
  title: Mapping QC
  questions:

    - question: How can I tell if my mapping results are accurate?
      incard: true
      answer: |
          Azimuth computes a series of metrics that relate to QC for the mapping procedure. We've found that a single metric is insufficient to describe the quality of mapping, and therefore compute each of the metrics below. We emphasize that users should not limit their evaluation of mapping to these QC metrics, and can should explore their results. In particular, we encourage users to explore whether the differentially expressed genes associated with each annotated biological population are consistent with their biological expectations. We intend to support these metrics and QC analyses with additional visualizations in future versions.

          Dataset-level Metrics:
            * % of query cells with anchors: The Azimuth reference-mapping procedure first identifies a set of 'anchors', or pairwise correspondences between cells predicted to be in a similar biological state, between query and reference datasets. Here we report the percentage of query cells participating in an anchor correspondence. Typically, we observe values >15% when mapping is successful. Processing mismatched biological datasets (i.e. mapping a query dataset of human brain cells onto a reference dataset of human blood cells) will return few anchors (<5%). However, in some cases, when there is an extremely large batch effect between query and reference datasets from the same tissue, this metric can fall below 15% even if mapping is successful.
            * Cluster preservation score: For each query dataset, we downsample to at most 5,000 cells, and perform an unsupervised clustering. Once cells have been mapped onto the reference dataset, we expect that this cluster structure will be preserved. This score reflects the preservation of this unsupervised cluster structure, and is based on the entropy of unsupervised cluster labels in each query cell's local neighborhood after mapping. Scores are scaled from 0 (poor) to 5 (best). This metric relies on the unsupervised clustering representing corresponding to biologically distinct cell states. If the query dataset consists of a homogeneous group of cells, or if the query dataset contains cells from multiple batches (which would be corrected by Azimuth), this metric may return a low value even in cases where mapping is successful. The score is calculated using the `ClusterPreservationScore` function in Azimuth.
            <br>

            
          Cell-level Metrics:
            * Prediction scores: Cell prediction scores range from 0 to 1 and reflect the confidence associated with each annotation. Cells with high-confidence annotations (for example, prediction scores > 0.75) reflect predictions that are supported by mulitple consistent anchors. Prediction scores can be visualized on the Feature Plots tab, or downloaded on the Download Results tab. The prediction depends on the specific annotation for each cell. Therefore, if you are mapping cells at multiple levels of resolution (for example level 1/2/3 annotations in the Human PBMC reference), each level will be associated with a different prediction score.
            * Mapping scores: This value from 0 to 1 reflects confidence that this cell is well represented by the reference. The "mapping.score" column is available to plot in the Feature Plots tab, and is provided in the download TSV file. The mapping score is independent of a specific annotation, and reflects how well the unique structure of a cell's local neighborhood is preserved during reference mapping.

    - question: How can a cell get a low prediction score and a high mapping score?
      incard: false
      answer: |
          A cell can get a low prediction score because its probability is equally split between two clusters (for example, for some cells, it may not be possible to confidently classify them between the two possibilities of CD4 Central Memory (CM), and Effector Memory (EM), which lowers the prediction score, but the mapping score will remain high.


    - question: How can a cell get a high prediction score and a low mapping score?
      incard: false
      answer: |
          A high prediction score means that a high proportion of reference cells near a query cell have the same label. However, these reference cells may not represent the query cell well, resulting in a low mapping score. Cell types that are not present in the reference should have lower mapping scores. For example, we have observed that query datasets containing neutrophils (which are not present in our reference), will be confidently annotated as CD14 Monocytes, as Monocytes are the closest cell type to neutrophils, but receive a low mapping score.
